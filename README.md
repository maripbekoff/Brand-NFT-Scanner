## Getting Started

NFT Brand Scanner is a mobile application designed to solve the problem of counterfeiting and verifying the authenticity of goods, especially in the context of branded clothing and accessories. We strive to provide users with the ability to easily and quickly verify the authenticity of goods using NFT technology (non-interchangeable tokens) and QR code scanning.
